Tesla Range Calculator made in ReactJS, inspired by [Todd Motto´s](https://github.com/toddmotto) Angular 2 [version](https://toddmotto.com/building-tesla-range-calculator-angular-2-reactive-forms).

Original range calculator is here: https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/models#battery-options

So far it´s only WIP, next thing I would like to add is PropTypes and fix the calculation (there are some random calculations now).
